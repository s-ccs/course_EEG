## General remarks to exercises
These exercises are not intendend to be brain teasers (they can be nevertheless ðŸ™ˆ) - this is by design. They are designed to help you think in different ways about the lecture material. The exercises are highly recommended but not mandatory. It is best if you generate a jupyter notebook for each exercise and upload it till the discussion session.

You are encouraged to work in groups of 2. 

Exercises are only graded pass/failed and if requested via e-mail I will provide feedback. Again: Exercises are not mandatory to pass the course. The course-grade is solely based on the semesterproject.
