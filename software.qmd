## mne-python

MNE Python is a general EEG processing, analysis and visualization toolbox. It will sufficice for 99% of your EEG analyses.

## mne-bids-pipeline

BIDS is a standardized format (mostly in terms of folder-structures), to save EEG (and other imaging) dataformats. On top of BIDS, one can relatively easily specify an MNE-pipeline using the `MNE-BIDS-Pipeline` package.

[get started here](https://mne.tools/mne-bids-pipeline/1.4/getting_started/install.html)

We recommend strongly to try it out in a tutorial and use it for your semester project data analysis!

## IClabel
a cool tool to automatically classify artefactual independent components is ICLabel. You can use it here: https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-icalabel

::: {.callout-warning}
I havent tested iclabel with mne-bids-pipeline, it should be compatible though.
