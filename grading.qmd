## Grading 


I will grade the report and code according to the following criteria:

- 20%  Code readability & code documentation
- 20%  Reproducibility & modularity
- 20%  Sanity Checks & sanity visualizations & their discussion* 
- 20%  Result visualization & Results documentation & interpretation 
- 20%  Scope of Project


Generally, you see that **documentation and explanations** are important. I do not (only) want to see that you analyzed the dataset, but I want to see what your motivation for choosing parameters is (parameteres like reference, filter settings, data removal criteria, algorithmic choices etc.). 

Regarding **readability**, I think direct-documentation (code-comments), style and modularity are key. 

Regarding **reproducibility**, it is important that you control and document the software versions, that your analysis scripts can be easily reproduced on another computer. If you are using mne-BIDS-pipeline you should already have a good start.


**Sanity checks** are small asserts & plots here and there, maybe even a unittest or two - small things that make sure your code is doing what it is supposed to be doing. 

Sentences starting with ("This seems correct, because xy", "this is strange because...", etc.) are expected. Such sentences give me an idea how much you understood the material.
